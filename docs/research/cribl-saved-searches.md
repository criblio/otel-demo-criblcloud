# Research: Cribl Saved Searches + Scheduled Searches + Alerts

Drives ROADMAP §2 — durable baselines, alerts, SLOs. Captured by
browser sniffing, JS bundle spelunking, and MCP-server reads of the
live `main-objective-shirley-sho21r7.cribl-staging.cloud` deployment.

Last captured: 2026-04-11.

## TL;DR

- **One API covers all of §2**: saved searches ARE scheduled searches
  ARE alerts. Adding a `schedule.enabled = true` + a
  `schedule.notifications.items[]` entry to a saved search is how you
  create a scheduled search with an alert.
- **No TypeScript SDK for Cribl Search saved searches.** The official
  `cribl-control-plane` and `cribl-mgmt-plane` SDKs are
  Stream/Workspace-focused; their `SavedJob` model is wired to
  `Collectors` (Stream collectors, not Search saved searches).
  We'll hit the REST API directly.
- **Auth from inside our pack iframe is free**: the platform fetch
  proxy injects `Authorization: Bearer <auth0-jwt>` automatically
  for any call to `CRIBL_API_URL + '/m/default_search/...'` — same
  mechanism we already use for `/search/jobs`.

## REST endpoints

Saved-search endpoints are prefixed with `CRIBL_API_URL +
'/m/default_search'` (= `/api/v1/m/default_search` at the network
layer). Notification targets are **top-level cross-product**
(not under `/m/...`). Verbs confirmed via live POST / GET /
DELETE round-trip and JS bundle spelunking.

### Saved searches

| Verb | Path | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/search/saved` | List saved searches. Supports `?limit=N&offset=M`. Response is `{items: [...], count: N}`. | ✅ confirmed |
| `POST` | `/search/saved` | Create. Body is a saved-search object (see schema). Client-chosen `id` respected. Returns `{items:[<created>], count:1}`. | ✅ confirmed by live round-trip |
| `GET` | `/search/saved/:id` | Get one. Returns `{items: [<one>], count: 1}` — still wrapped. | ✅ confirmed |
| `PATCH` | `/search/saved/:id` | Update (partial). | 🟡 inferred from JS bundle |
| `DELETE` | `/search/saved/:id` | Delete. Returns the deleted object. `GET` afterward 404s. | ✅ confirmed by live round-trip |
| `GET` | `/search/saved/:id/results` | Fetch results of past scheduled runs. **Returned 404 for `tailscale_offline`**; likely needs a search that actually produced output OR a different prefix. Superseded by `dataset="$vt_results" jobName=...` for baseline reads. | 🟡 partial |
| `POST` | `/search/saved/:id/notifications` | Create a notification on a saved search. | 🟡 inferred from JS bundle |
| `PATCH` | `/search/saved/:id/notifications/:notificationId` | Update. | 🟡 inferred |
| `DELETE` | `/search/saved/:id/notifications/:notificationId` | Delete. | 🟡 inferred |

### Notification targets (cross-product)

| Verb | Path | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/notification-targets` | List all cross-product notification targets (webhooks, Slack, PagerDuty, SNS, email, system_messages). | ✅ confirmed |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/notification-targets` | Create a target. | 🟡 inferred |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/notification-targets/:id` | Update. | 🟡 inferred |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/notification-targets/:id` | Delete. | 🟡 inferred |

A notification target ID (e.g., `typhoon_ntfy`) is referenced
from a saved search's `schedule.notifications.items[].targets[]`.
Targets created in any Cribl product are visible from all of
them. UI path: `Settings > Search > Notification Targets`.

### Related endpoints observed in passing

| Verb | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/search/datasets` | List available datasets. |
| `GET` | `/search/dataset-providers` | List dataset provider types (cribl_search, cribl_leader, cribl_edge, s3, minio, …). |
| `GET` | `/search/macros` | KQL macros. |
| `GET` | `/search/dashboard-categories` | Dashboard groupings (saved-search based). |
| `POST` | `/search/jobs` | Run a live search job — already in use by `api/cribl.ts`. |

## Saved search schema

Captured from live examples (`tailscale_offline`, `dummy_alert`,
`Pihole_DNS_Queries`, `OS_Lookup`, `cribl_search_finished_1h`, etc).

  "isPrivate": true,
  "query": "cribl dataset=\"tailscale\" | lookup monitored_hosts on hostname | where connectedToControl==false and monitored==\"true\" | extend lastSeenParsed=... | where lastSeenParsed < ago(1h) | project hostname",

        "targets": ["typhoon_ntfy"],
        "conf": {
          "triggerType": "resultsCount",
          "triggerComparator": ">",
          "triggerCount": 0,
          "savedQueryId": "tailscale_offline",

        "targetConfigs": [
          { "id": "typhoon_ntfy", "conf": { "includeResults": true, "attachmentType": "inline" } }
        ],
        "group": "default_search"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Auth model (from inside our pack)

- The Cribl UI loads an Auth0 SPA bundle that stores a JWT access
  token in `localStorage` under `@@auth0spajs@@::...::...`.
- Each API call is made with `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
- **For our pack**, the iframe fetch proxy described in
  `oteldemo/AGENTS.md` injects this header automatically. We already
  rely on this for `/search/jobs` — same mechanism applies to
  `/search/saved`.
- Research limitation: `fetch()` from `page.evaluate()` in a driven
  browser does NOT inherit the header (the token is in JS memory,
  not cookies). To probe endpoints directly from a script, read
  the token out of `localStorage` first:
  ```js
  const token = JSON.parse(
    Object.entries(localStorage).find(([k]) => k.startsWith('@@auth0spajs@@'))[1]
  ).body.access_token;
  ```

## SDK situation

`npm search @criblio` turns up two official TypeScript SDKs:

- **`cribl-control-plane`** — Stream resources (sources, destinations,
  routes, pipelines, workers). Uses the Cribl OpenAPI spec via
  Speakeasy codegen. `SavedJob`-related operations exist in the
  model directory but are wired into the `Collectors` SDK class
  (Stream's scheduled data-collection jobs). **Does not cover
  Cribl Search saved searches.**
- **`cribl-mgmt-plane`** — Workspaces, API credentials, health. Tiny.
  **Does not cover Cribl Search saved searches.**

There is **no official TS SDK for Cribl Search**. We hit `/search/*`
REST directly. If one lands later, we'd want to swap it in.

## Persistence options — the three mechanisms

There are three ways to persist output from a scheduled search
for later reads. All confirmed via Cribl docs.

### Option A: `$vt_results` (automatic retention)

Every saved-search execution is automatically kept in the
`$vt_results` virtual table for a default 7 days (configurable
at `Settings > Search > Limits > Search history TTL`).

**Read syntax:**
```kql
dataset="$vt_results" jobName="my_saved_search"
// or the Nth-previous run:
dataset="$vt_results" jobName="my_saved_search" execution=-1
// or all history:
dataset="$vt_results" jobName="my_saved_search" execution=*
// or by explicit job ID (supports arrays):
dataset="$vt_results" jobId=["id1","id2"]
```

**Write**: free, automatic — every scheduled run retains its
results with no `| export` or `| send` step needed.

**Drawbacks**:
- Reading actually runs a search against the stored results,
  which consumes search credits (distinct from the free
  "open from History" UI action).
- Retention capped at the TTL setting (default 7 days).
- Not a fast index lookup — every read adds a search job.

### Option B: `export ... to lookup` (explicit materialization)

The `| export` operator at the end of a query materializes its
output as a workspace-scoped lookup CSV.

**Syntax (full):**
```
... | export [ mode=Mode ]
             [ description=Description ]
             [ suppressPreviews=Previews ]
             [ fieldMapping=src1:dst1,src2:dst2 ]
             [ compress=auto|true|false ]
             to lookup LookupName
             [ tee=true|false ]
             [ maxEvents=N ]
```

**Modes:**
- `create` — fail if the lookup exists (default if omitted on
  a fresh install)
- `overwrite` — replace the lookup contents atomically on every
  run (**the mode we want for baselines**)
- `append` — accumulate rows across runs

**Limits:**
- Hard cap of 10,000 rows (`maxEvents` defaults to this and
  can't exceed it).
- Admin/Editor role required to run `export`.
- Scope is workspace, not pack — can't write pack lookups.

**Read syntax:**
```kql
... | lookup my_baselines on svc, op
```

A `lookup` is a hash-join against a cached CSV in workspace
state — **sub-millisecond overhead on the search pipeline**.
Not another search job.

**Example scheduled-search body:**
```kql
dataset="otel"
| where isnotnull(end_time_unix_nano)
| extend svc=tostring(resource.attributes['service.name']),
         dur_us=(toreal(end_time_unix_nano)-toreal(start_time_unix_nano))/1000.0
| where dur_us < 30000000
| summarize requests=count(),
            p50_us=percentile(dur_us, 50),
            p95_us=percentile(dur_us, 95),
            p99_us=percentile(dur_us, 99)
  by svc, op=name
| export mode=overwrite
         description="Trace Explorer operation baselines"
         to lookup traceexplorer_op_baselines
```

### Option C: `| send` (round-trip through Stream)

The `| send` operator forwards results to a Cribl HTTP Source
as a POST of NDJSON. Once ingested, the data follows whatever
Stream pipeline / destination the HTTP Source is routed to,
and can then be read as a normal dataset.

**Syntax:**
```
... | send [ tee=true|false ] [ group=WorkerGroup | "URL" ]
```

**Defaults:**
- Targets the Cribl HTTP Source in your Cribl Cloud Organization
- Default group: `default`, default port: `10200`
- No ingest charge for same-workspace routing
- Content-Type: `application/x-ndjson`

**Use case**: long-term baselines beyond lookup's 10k row cap,
or feeding results to a dataset another product can query.
Requires a Stream HTTP Source to be configured and pointed at
a destination, which is a multi-step config. Heavier than
`export to lookup`.

### Comparison for our baseline use case

| Factor | `$vt_results` | `export to lookup` | `send` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Write effort at end of scheduled search | None (free) | `\| export mode=overwrite to lookup X` | `\| send` + HTTP Source config |
| Retention | 7d default | Permanent until overwritten/deleted | Depends on destination |
| Read mechanism | Another search job against stored results | Hash-join on cached CSV | Normal dataset scan |
| Read speed | Slow (new search job) | **Sub-millisecond** | Normal dataset read |
| Read cost | Credit-charged | Free | Credit-charged |
| Idempotent upsert | Automatic per run | `mode=overwrite` | No — append-only to destination |
| Row cap | Not stated | 10,000 hard cap | None |
| Role required | Any search user | Admin/Editor | Any search user |
| Scope | Workspace | Workspace (not pack) | Stream-routed |

### Recommendation for §2b

**`export mode=overwrite to lookup` is the winner** for the
operation-baseline use case:

1. Baselines are small (~100–1,000 `(svc, op)` rows) — well under
   the 10k cap.
2. The critical path is **read speed**: the live anomaly query
   runs on every Home refresh, and we can't afford to stand up
   another search job for each read. Hash-join on a lookup CSV
   is effectively free.
3. Idempotency is built in: `mode=overwrite` atomically replaces
   the lookup on every scheduled run, no diff logic.
4. Operators can inspect the lookup directly via the UI.

The Admin/Editor role requirement for `export` is a consideration
for §2e (first-run provisioning) but not a blocker: whoever
installs the pack is almost certainly an Admin. If they're not,
the provisioning dialog will surface a clear error.

`$vt_results` would be the fallback if we hit the 10k row cap or
if the Admin/Editor role ends up being a problem. The anomaly
detector could be restructured to issue one search per
`(svc, op)` anomaly candidate, reading the baseline on demand
from `$vt_results`, but the read cost per Home page load would
balloon.

`send` is the right mechanism for feeding long-term storage or
cross-workspace data flows — not baselines.

## Remaining unknowns (much shorter list than before)

1. **`/search/saved/:id/results` endpoint path**. The JS bundle
   constructs `/search/saved/${id}/results`, but our probe 404'd
   on `tailscale_offline`. **Not blocking §2b**: the canonical
   read path for scheduled search output is
   `dataset="$vt_results" jobName=...`, which IS documented and
   supported. The `/results` HTTP endpoint is superseded by the
   virtual table for our needs.
2. **Install-time hook on the App Platform**. `AGENTS.md` does not
   mention one. File as a platform feature request; design around
   a first-run dialog for now (§2e).
3. **Idempotent naming convention confirmed safe**. Our POST probe
   used `id: "__traceexplorer_research_probe__"` and the server
   respected it. Proposal stands: prefix all app-managed IDs with
   `traceexplorer__` so the pack can diff-upsert on upgrade
   without touching user rows.

Everything else that was previously "partial" or "open" is
resolved.

## Next concrete steps for §2b

1. **Write the provisioner.** A node script under `scripts/` that:
   - Loads a declarative config (e.g.
     `oteldemo/config/provisioned-searches.yml`) listing the
     scheduled searches the app needs
   - Reads the Auth0 token from `localStorage` (for dev) or from
     the platform fetch proxy (at app runtime)
   - For each config entry, ensures a saved search exists with
     the right `id`, `query`, `schedule.cronSchedule`, and
     `schedule.enabled=true`
   - Diffs the current set against expected (filter by
     `id.startsWith("traceexplorer__")`) and upserts/deletes
   - Writes a `traceexplorer__provisioned_version` KV key on
     success so upgrades can re-run migrations selectively
2. **Ship the first scheduled search**: the per-op baseline.
   Query body captured above; schedule: `0 * * * *` (hourly)
   or `*/10 * * * *` (every 10 minutes, if we want faster
   baseline refresh). `keepLastN: 2` is fine since the lookup
   is the source of truth for reads.
3. **Re-wire `listOperationAnomalies`** to read the baseline
   via `lookup traceexplorer_op_baselines on svc, op` instead
   of an ad-hoc 24h query. This drops the 22s blocking query
   to roughly the same cost as the current-window-only fetch
   (~2-3s), unblocking the parked `OperationAnomalyList`.
4. **Re-add the widget** to the Home page and remove the
   parking breadcrumbs (`HomePage.tsx` comment, `HEALTH_LEGEND`
   entry, `anomalousServices` arg threading).
5. **Handle the first-run case** where the baseline lookup
   doesn't exist yet (fresh install, provisioned search hasn't
   run its first cycle). Detection: `lookup` on a missing file
   either errors or returns empty — branch: if the anomaly
   join yields zero rows, fall back to "baselines still being
   computed" empty state instead of "no anomalies".
