/**
 * Map a service's recent stats into a health bucket + display color.
 *
 * Two independent signals feed the bucket:
 *
 *  - Error rate (primary): countif(status=error) / count(). Error-
 *    rate bucketing stays as-is — watch / warn / critical thresholds
 *    at 0 / 1% / 5%. Always-slow is not the same as unhealthy (the
 *    workload may just be compute-heavy), so latency doesn't drive
 *    color.
 *  - Traffic-drop: a significant fall in request rate vs the
 *    immediately-previous window of the same length. Catches the
 *    class of outages where a service is quietly starving for work
 *    (upstream kafka lag, stuck consumer, failed job runner) —
 *    error rate stays at 0, latency is fine, but requests just
 *    stop arriving. Error rate alone would keep the service green.
 *
 * Bucket precedence: if error rate is already at `warn`/`critical`
 * severity the error bucket wins (an erroring service is still
 * erroring regardless of volume). Below that, a significant traffic
 * drop promotes to `traffic_drop` so the signal doesn't get lost
 * among the green rows.
