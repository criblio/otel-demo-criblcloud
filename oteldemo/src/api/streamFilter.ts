/**
 * Shared "long-poll / idle-wait" trace filter.
 *
 * Background: the Home "Slowest trace classes" panel and the Search
 * results list are routinely dominated by traces that are "long" but
 * not "slow". Two common shapes:
 *
 *  1. **Persistent streaming connections** — gRPC server-streaming /
 *     SSE / websockets / HTTP long-poll. The root span holds the
 *     connection open for minutes at a time. Typical example:
 *     `flagd.evaluation.v1.Service/EventStream` at 600s.
 *
 *  2. **Idle-wait loops around kafka consumers** — the service wraps
 *     an entire consume iteration (including the idle poll wait) in
 *     one span. Typical example: `accounting order-consumed` at 98s
 *     with 4 tiny children that together account for ~140ms — the
 *     other 97.86 seconds is the consumer blocking on poll().
 *
 * Both shapes share the same diagnostic property: **the work inside
 * the trace is not attributed to any child span**. A well-
 * instrumented slow trace always delegates its slowness to at least
 * one child (DB call, downstream RPC, internal queue wait) because
 * that's where the time went. A trace whose longest non-root span
 * is a tiny fraction of the root's duration can't actually be
 * diagnosed from the trace data alone — whatever happened, it
 * happened invisibly inside the root.
 *
 * There's one wrinkle: gRPC streaming RPCs emit TWO spans in the
 * same trace — a client-side stream span and a server-side stream
 * span, both spanning the full 600s lifetime of the connection.
 * Ratio-only analysis treats this like a legitimate "single long
 * child did all the work" trace, even though it's the same
 * persistent-connection noise we want to filter. To catch that,
 * we also keep the earlier span-count rule.
 *
 * Combined heuristic: a trace is filtered when
 *   - trace_duration > STREAM_DURATION_US (default 30s), AND
 *   - (
 *       span_count < STREAM_MIN_SPAN_COUNT (default 3)
 *       OR max(non_root_dur) / trace_duration < STREAM_CHILD_RATIO
 *       (default 10%)
 *     )
 *
 * This correctly filters 1-span flagd streams, 2-span flagd
 * client+server streams, and 4-span accounting idle-wait loops.
 * It does NOT filter nested slow traces whose slowness is
 * attributed to a real descendant span, and it does not filter
 * legitimate fast traces regardless of shape.
 *
 * The filter is exposed as a user setting (default on). Persisted in
 * the pack-scoped KV store alongside the dataset preference. The
 * module maintains a pub/sub so pages can re-fetch when the toggle
 * changes, using the same pattern as `dataset.ts`.

/**
 * **Span-level** KQL fragment for aggregation queries that compute
 * percentiles and counts over raw spans (not trace-level rollups).
 * Appended to a pipeline that has already computed a `dur_us` column
 * on each span.
 *
 * Why a different filter shape: percentile queries don't have
 * trace-wide context (span count, max_non_root_dur) because they
 * aggregate across spans, not traces. At the span level the cleanest
 * heuristic is a duration cap: any individual span longer than
 * STREAM_DURATION_US (30s) is almost certainly a streaming connection
 * or an idle-wait loop. Empirically verified against the OTel demo
 * dataset — in a typical hour, every span > 30s is either a
 * flagd.evaluation.v1.Service/EventStream or an accounting
 * order-consumed idle-wait root. Nothing legitimate crosses 30s.
 *
 * The cap is strict: it filters out the ENTIRE span, including its
 * contribution to service percentiles, operation percentiles, and
 * dependency-edge stats. This is what "hide the noise from summaries"
 * means in practice.
 *
 * Affects (via the query builders in queries.ts):
 *   - serviceSummary / listServiceSummaries (Home catalog + ServiceDetail hero)
 *   - serviceTimeSeries (ServiceDetail RED charts)
 *   - serviceOperations (ServiceDetail Top Operations)
 *   - dependencies (arch graph RPC edges)
 *   - messagingDependencies (arch graph messaging edges)
 *
 * Does NOT affect:
 *   - findTraces (Search is an explicit user query — show what was asked for)
 *   - traceLogs / searchLogs (log queries, not span-duration-based)
 *   - traceSpans (single-trace detail — show the full trace)
